# Module 21 Challenge: Alphabet Soup Charity Optimization

## Overview

This project involves developing and optimizing a deep learning model to predict the success of funding applications for a fictional charity, Alphabet Soup. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Structure

### Main Files and Folders

- **Starter_Code.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the initial code for the analysis and model training.
- **AlphabetSoupCharity.h5**: HDF5 file containing the initial trained model.
- **AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5**: HDF5 file containing the optimized model.
- **README.md**: Documentation file for the project.

### Data Files

- **weights.05.hdf5** to **weights.100.hdf5**: Checkpoint files for the model training process.

## How to Run the Analysis

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```sh
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd [project-directory]
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Open and run the `Starter_Code.ipynb` notebook to perform the analysis and model training.

## Analysis

The analysis includes:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
- Model Training: Developing and training deep learning models to predict the success of funding applications.
- Model Optimization: Optimizing the model to improve its performance.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using various metrics.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to develop, train, and optimize deep learning models for predicting the success of funding applications. The results help in understanding the factors influencing the success of funding applications and the effectiveness of the models.
