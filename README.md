### Crowdfunding Analysis
- **Dataset**: `CrowdfundingBook (version 2).xlsx`
- **Description**: Analysis of crowdfunding campaigns to draw insights and conclusions.
- **Key Findings**: 
  1. Successful campaigns tend to exceed their funding goals, providing surplus funds for enhancing project quality.
