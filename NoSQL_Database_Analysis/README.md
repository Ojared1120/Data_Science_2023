# Module 12 Challenge: NoSQL Database Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing data using NoSQL databases. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Structure

- `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for setting up the NoSQL database.
- `NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing data within the NoSQL database.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Instructions

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure that any necessary datasets are placed in the appropriate directory.

2. **Setting Up the NoSQL Database**:
   - Open and run the `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb` notebook to set up the NoSQL database.

3. **Running the Analysis**:
   - Open and run the `NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb` notebook to perform the data analysis.

## Analysis

The analysis includes:
- Setting up and configuring a NoSQL database.
- Importing data into the NoSQL database.
- Performing various data queries and analysis within the NoSQL database.

## Conclusion
