# Module 22 Challenge: Home Sales Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing home sales data to gain insights into the housing market. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Structure

### Main Files and Folders

- **Home_Sales_starter_code_colab.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the home sales analysis.
- **README.md**: Documentation file for the project.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is not provided here but should be included in the notebook or as a separate file if necessary.

## How to Run the Analysis

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```sh
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd [project-directory]
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Open and run the `Home_Sales_starter_code_colab.ipynb` notebook to perform the analysis.

## Analysis

The analysis includes:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data through various visualizations and summary statistics.
- Modeling: Building and evaluating models to predict home sales prices.
- Results Visualization: Visualizing the results of the analysis and modeling.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to analyze and model home sales data using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The results help in understanding the factors influencing home sales prices and the effectiveness of the models.
