Project Title: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store

Objective: The main objective of this project is to understand the sales trend and derive insights to improve sales performance.

Data: You can use a dataset from a retail store which includes information like date of purchase, product category, product description, quantity, unit price, customer ID, and country. You can find such datasets on platforms like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, etc.

Steps:

    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Start by cleaning the data. Handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types. Also, create new features if necessary. For example, from the date of purchase, you can extract the month, day of the week, hour of the day, etc.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the data to understand the sales trend. Some questions you can answer are:
        What is the overall sales trend?
        Which are the top 10 selling products?
        Which is the most profitable product category?
        Which are the busiest hours of the day or days of the week?
        Which country has the highest sales?

    Data Visualization: Visualize your findings using different types of plots like line plots, bar plots, pie charts, etc. This will make your findings more understandable. Ensure to create at least 6-8 visualizations and provide clear and accurate labeling for each.

    Customer Segmentation: Use clustering techniques like K-Means to segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior. This can help in targeted marketing.

    Sales Forecasting: Use time series analysis or regression models to forecast future sales. This will help the store to manage its inventory better.

    Insights and Recommendations: Based on your analysis, provide insights and recommendations to improve the sales performance. Ensure to support your findings with numbers and visualizations.
