# Module 5 Challenge: Pymaceuticals

## Overview

This project involves analyzing data from a pharmaceutical study on mice. The goal is to determine the effectiveness of various drug regimens in reducing tumor size over time.

## Project Structure

- `pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb`: The main script for analyzing the study data.
- `Mouse_metadata.csv`: The dataset containing metadata about the mice used in the study.
- `Study_results.csv`: The dataset containing the study results.

## Data

The datasets used in this project include:
- `Mouse_metadata.csv`: Contains information about the mice, such as their unique ID, gender, age, and drug regimen.
- `Study_results.csv`: Contains the results of the study, including measurements of tumor size over time for each mouse.

## Instructions

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure that the `Mouse_metadata.csv` and `Study_results.csv` files are placed in the appropriate directory.

2. **Running the Script**:
   - Open and run the `pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb` notebook to perform the analysis.

3. **Viewing Results**:
   - The results will be displayed within the Jupyter Notebook as plots and summary statistics.

## Analysis

The analysis includes:
- Merging the datasets to create a complete dataset.
- Calculating summary statistics for the tumor size measurements.
- Generating bar and pie charts to visualize the distribution of mice across drug regimens and genders.
- Calculating the correlation between tumor size and weight.
- Generating scatter plots and linear regression models to visualize the relationship between tumor size and weight.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into the effectiveness of different drug regimens in reducing tumor size in mice. It demonstrates the ability to process and analyze biomedical data using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
