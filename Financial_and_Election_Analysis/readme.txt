# Module 3 Challenge: PyBank and PyPoll

## Overview

This module includes two projects: PyBank and PyPoll. Each project involves analyzing data to provide valuable insights. The PyBank project focuses on financial analysis, while the PyPoll project focuses on election results.

## Project Structure

### PyBank

- `PyBankScript.ipynb`: The main script for the PyBank analysis.
- `budget_data.csv`: The dataset containing financial data.
- `financial_analysis.txt`: The output file containing the financial analysis results.

### PyPoll

- `PyPollscript.ipynb`: The main script for the PyPoll analysis.
- `election_data.csv`: The dataset containing election data.
- `election_analysis.txt`: The output file containing the election results analysis.

## Data

### PyBank

The PyBank project uses financial data to calculate:
- Total months in the dataset
- Total amount of profit/losses
- Average change in profit/losses over the period
- Greatest increase in profits (date and amount)
- Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount)

### PyPoll

The PyPoll project uses election data to calculate:
- Total number of votes cast
- Percentage of votes each candidate received
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Instructions

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure that the `budget_data.csv` file is placed in the appropriate directory for PyBank.
   - Ensure that the `election_data.csv` file is placed in the appropriate directory for PyPoll.
   
2. **Running the Scripts**:
   - Open and run the `PyBankScript.ipynb` notebook to perform the financial analysis.
   - Open and run the `PyPollscript.ipynb` notebook to perform the election analysis.

3. **Viewing Results**:
   - For PyBank, refer to the `financial_analysis.txt` file for the financial analysis results.
   - For PyPoll, refer to the `election_analysis.txt` file for the election results.

## Results

### PyBank

**Financial Analysis**:
- Total Months: 86
- Total: $22,564,198
- Average Change: $-8311.11
- Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1,862,002)
- Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1,825,558)

### PyPoll

**Election Results**:
- Total Votes: 369,711
- Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85,213)
- Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272,892)
- Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11,606)
- **Winner**: Diana DeGette

## Conclusion

This module demonstrates the ability to process and analyze both financial and election data using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The results provide valuable insights into financial performance and election outcomes.
