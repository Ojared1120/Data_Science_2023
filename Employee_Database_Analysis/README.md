# Module 9 Challenge: Employee Database Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing an employee database to gain insights into various aspects of employee information and organizational structure. The analysis is performed using SQL and Python.

## Project Structure

- `QuickDBD-employees.png`: Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the employee database.
- `QuickDBD-employees.sql`: SQL file to create the database schema.
- `departments.csv`: Dataset containing information about departments.
- `dept_emp.csv`: Dataset containing information about the relationship between employees and departments.
- `dept_manager.csv`: Dataset containing information about department managers.
- `employees.csv`: Dataset containing information about employees.
- `salaries.csv`: Dataset containing information about employee salaries.
- `titles.csv`: Dataset containing information about employee titles.
- `table_schemata.sql`: SQL file to create the tables and import the data.
- `daq1.sql` to `daq8.sql`: SQL query files to perform various data analyses.
- `dereq1234.sql`: Additional SQL query file.
- `Querycreation.sql`: SQL query file for creating specific queries.

## Data

The datasets used in this project include:
- `departments.csv`: Contains information about departments such as department number and department name.
- `dept_emp.csv`: Contains information about the relationship between employees and departments.
- `dept_manager.csv`: Contains information about department managers.
- `employees.csv`: Contains information about employees such as employee number, birth date, first name, last name, gender, and hire date.
- `salaries.csv`: Contains information about employee salaries.
- `titles.csv`: Contains information about employee titles.

## Instructions

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure that all CSV files are placed in the appropriate directory.
   - Use the `QuickDBD-employees.sql` and `table_schemata.sql` files to create the database schema.

2. **Running the Analysis**:
   - Use SQL to create tables and import the data from the CSV files.
   - Execute the SQL query files (`daq1.sql` to `daq8.sql`, `dereq1234.sql`, `Querycreation.sql`) to perform various data analyses.

3. **Viewing Results**:
   - The results of the analysis will be displayed within the database management system as query results and visualizations.

## Analysis

The analysis includes:
- Creating an entity relationship diagram (ERD) to visualize the database structure.
- Writing SQL queries to analyze employee data, such as average salary by title, total number of employees in each department, and more.
- Generating visualizations to display the results of the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into the organizational structure and employee information using SQL. It demonstrates the ability to design and query databases, as well as to visualize data for better understanding.
