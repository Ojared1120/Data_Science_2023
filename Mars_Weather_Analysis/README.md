# Module 11 Challenge: Mars Weather Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing weather data from Mars to understand climate patterns and trends. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Structure

- `part_1_mars_news.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing Mars news.
- `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing Mars weather data.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
- `mars_weather.csv`: Dataset containing weather data from Mars.
- `Average Pressure by Month.png`: Visualization of average pressure by month.
- `Average Temperature by Month.png`: Visualization of average temperature by month.
- `Terrestrial Date vs Minimum Temperature.png`: Visualization of terrestrial date versus minimum temperature.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes:
- `mars_weather.csv`: Contains weather data from Mars, including information on temperature, pressure, and other atmospheric conditions.

## Instructions

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure that the `mars_weather.csv` file is placed in the appropriate directory.

2. **Running the Analysis**:
   - Open and run the `part_1_mars_news.ipynb` notebook to analyze Mars news.
   - Open and run the `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb` notebook to analyze Mars weather data.

3. **Viewing Results**:
   - The results of the analysis will be displayed within the Jupyter Notebooks as plots and summary statistics.
   - Visualizations such as `Average Pressure by Month.png`, `Average Temperature by Month.png`, and `Terrestrial Date vs Minimum Temperature.png` will provide insights into the climate patterns on Mars.

## Analysis

The analysis includes:
- Extracting and summarizing news articles about Mars.
- Exploring Mars weather data to identify patterns and trends.
- Visualizing the relationship between different weather variables.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into the climate patterns and atmospheric conditions on Mars using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The results help in understanding the Martian climate and its variations over time.
