# Module 6 Challenge: WeatherPy and VacationPy

## Overview

This module includes two projects: WeatherPy and VacationPy. The WeatherPy project involves analyzing weather data to explore the relationship between weather conditions and geographic locations. The VacationPy project involves using weather data to recommend ideal vacation destinations based on user preferences.

## Project Structure

### WeatherPy

- `WeatherPy.ipynb`: The main script for analyzing weather data.
- `cities.csv`: The dataset containing city weather data.
- `Fig1.png`, `Fig2.png`, `Fig3.png`, `Fig4.png`: Figures illustrating the relationship between latitude and various weather metrics (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed).

### VacationPy

- `VacationPy.ipynb`: The main script for recommending vacation destinations.
- `.gitignore`: To exclude sensitive files from being tracked by Git.
- `api_keys.py`: File to store API keys securely.
- `api_keys.cpython-311.pyc`: Compiled Python file for API keys.

## Data

The datasets used in these projects include:
- `cities.csv`: Contains weather data for various cities around the world, including information on temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.

## Instructions

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure that the `cities.csv` file is placed in the appropriate directory.
   - Ensure that the `api_keys.py` file contains your API keys and is correctly configured.

2. **Running the Scripts**:
   - Open and run the `WeatherPy.ipynb` notebook to perform the weather data analysis.
   - Open and run the `VacationPy.ipynb` notebook to generate vacation destination recommendations.

3. **Viewing Results**:
   - The results for WeatherPy will be displayed within the Jupyter Notebook as plots and summary statistics.
   - The results for VacationPy will be displayed within the Jupyter Notebook, including recommended vacation destinations based on the weather data.

## Analysis

### WeatherPy

The analysis includes:
- Plotting the relationship between latitude and max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.
- Generating scatter plots to visualize these relationships.

### VacationPy

The analysis includes:
- Using weather data to filter cities based on ideal weather conditions for vacations.
- Plotting the selected vacation destinations on a map.

## Conclusion

This module demonstrates the ability to process and analyze weather data using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The results provide valuable insights into the relationship between weather conditions and geographic locations and help identify ideal vacation destinations based on user preferences.
