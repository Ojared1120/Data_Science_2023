# Module Challenge 4: PyCitySchools

## Overview

The PyCitySchools project involves analyzing school performance data to gain insights into various factors affecting student performance. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Structure

- `PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb`: The main script for analyzing school performance data.
- `schools_complete.csv`: The dataset containing information about schools.
- `students_complete.csv`: The dataset containing information about students.

## Data

The datasets used in this project include:
- `schools_complete.csv`: Contains information about schools, such as school name, type, and budget.
- `students_complete.csv`: Contains information about students, such as student name, gender, grade, and scores.

## Instructions

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure that the `schools_complete.csv` and `students_complete.csv` files are placed in the appropriate directory.

2. **Running the Script**:
   - Open and run the `PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb` notebook to perform the analysis.

3. **Viewing Results**:
   - The results will be displayed within the Jupyter Notebook as tables and summary statistics.

## Analysis

The analysis includes:
- Calculating summary statistics for school performance.
- Generating various metrics such as the average math and reading scores, overall passing rate, and performance by school type and budget.
- Creating visualizations to display the relationship between different factors and student performance.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into the performance of schools and students based on various factors. It demonstrates the ability to process and analyze educational data using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
