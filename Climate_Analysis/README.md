# Module 10 Challenge: Climate Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing climate data to explore patterns and trends. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main application script for performing the climate analysis.
- `climate_starter.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the climate analysis code and results.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
- `Images/`: Directory containing images and visualizations generated during the analysis (to include `precipitation.png` and `temperature_vs_frequency.png`).
- `Resources/`: Directory containing the dataset used for the analysis.
  - `hawaii.sqlite`
  - `hawaii_measurements.csv`
  - `hawaii_stations.csv`

## Data

The datasets used in this project include:
- `hawaii.sqlite`: SQLite database containing climate data for Hawaii.
- `hawaii_measurements.csv`: CSV file containing climate measurements.
- `hawaii_stations.csv`: CSV file containing information about weather stations.

## Instructions

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure that the `hawaii.sqlite` file is placed in the appropriate directory.
   - Ensure that the `hawaii_measurements.csv` and `hawaii_stations.csv` files are placed in the `Resources` directory.

2. **Running the Analysis**:
   - Open and run the `climate_starter.ipynb` notebook to perform the climate analysis.
   - Alternatively, run the `app.py` script to perform the analysis.

3. **Viewing Results**:
   - The results of the analysis will be displayed within the Jupyter Notebook as plots and summary statistics.
   - Visualizations such as `precipitation.png` and `temperature_vs_frequency.png` will be saved in the `Images` directory.

## Analysis

The analysis includes:
- Exploring climate data to identify patterns and trends.
- Visualizing the relationship between different climate variables.
- Generating summary statistics and plots to better understand the climate data.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into climate patterns and trends using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The results help in understanding the relationship between various climate variables and their impact on weather conditions.
