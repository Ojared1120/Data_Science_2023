# Deep Learning Challenge - Alphabet Soup Charity Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to create a binary classifier using deep learning techniques to predict the success of applicants seeking funding from the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup. The dataset provided contains information on over 34,000 organizations that have received funding, including various metadata about each organization.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Preprocess the Data

- **Data Reading**: Load the `charity_data.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Target and Features Identification**: Identify target variables and features.
- **Data Cleaning**: Drop unnecessary columns like EIN and NAME.
- **Unique Values Analysis**: Determine the number of unique values and bin rare categorical variables.
- **Encoding**: Use `pd.get_dummies()` to encode categorical variables.
- **Data Splitting**: Split the preprocessed data into features (X) and target (y) arrays, and further into training and testing datasets.
- **Feature Scaling**: Scale the features using `StandardScaler`.

### Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model

- **Model Creation**: Design a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Layer Setup**: Create hidden layers with appropriate activation functions.
- **Output Layer**: Create an output layer with a suitable activation function.
- **Model Structure**: Check the model's structure.
- **Compilation and Training**: Compile and train the model.
- **Callbacks**: Implement callbacks for saving model weights.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance in terms of loss and accuracy.
- **Model Saving**: Save the model as `AlphabetSoupCharity.h5`.

### Step 3: Optimize the Model

- **Model Optimization**: Aim to achieve a predictive accuracy higher than 75%.
- **Adjustments**: Consider adjusting the input data, modifying the model structure, or experimenting with different training parameters.
