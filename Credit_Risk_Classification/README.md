# Module 20 Challenge: Credit Risk Classification

## Overview

This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify the credit risk of loan applicants. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Structure

### Main Files and Folders

- **credit_risk_classification.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the credit risk classification analysis.
- **lending_data.csv**: CSV file containing the lending data for analysis.
- **report-template.md**: Report template for documenting the analysis and results.
- **README.md**: Documentation file for the project.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes:
- **lending_data.csv**: Contains lending data, including loan information and borrower details.

## How to Run the Analysis

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```sh
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd [project-directory]
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Open and run the `credit_risk_classification.ipynb` notebook to perform the analysis.

## Analysis

The analysis includes:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
- Model Training: Developing and training machine learning models to classify credit risk.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using various metrics.
- Results Documentation: Documenting the analysis and results in the `report-template.md`.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to develop and evaluate machine learning models for credit risk classification. The results help in understanding the factors influencing credit risk and the effectiveness of the models.
